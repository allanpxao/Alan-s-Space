This repository gathers my programming projects developed with **Python** and **JavaScript**.  
It also includes work focused on **Data Analysis** using libraries such as **Pandas** and **NumPy**.  
It serves as a space for experimentation, continuous learning, and creative problem-solving.

### 🐍 **Python** 

🔍 Main focus: Data Analysis — developing skills in data manipulation, transformation, and visualization.

📘 Numpy Library 
Efficient handling of arrays and multidimensional matrices.  
High-performance tools for linear algebra, random number generation, and simulations.

📙 Pandas Library 
Data structures like DataFrame and Series for tabular data.  
Data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis with real-world datasets (CSV, Excel, JSON, etc.).
